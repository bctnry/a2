# [A2 Operating System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A2_(operating_system)) 

This is a copy of original [A2 Repository (defunc)](https://trac.inf.ethz.ch/trac/lecturers/a2) at ETH-Zürich, which should be available (as of March 2024) at its [newer place at ETHZ](https://gitlab.inf.ethz.ch/felixf/oberon).  

The stuff available here is a coopy of the former SVN repository; it was obsoleted by [metacore's active, but unoffical mirror copy of a2](https://github.com/metacore/A2OS), which is updated regularily (at least afaik). The repository here was handed over to me by github user Ignat99 in October 2017; I had intended to do the same as metacore (synchronize the git repository with the subversion repository), but I found metacore's repo some time later and since I did not want to duplicate metacore's achievement, I did not follow up my original idea. 

Ignat99 had enriched the original mirror by other interesting stuff, especially:

1. Extra ISO image [A2_Rev-6498_serial-trace.iso](http://sourceforge.net/projects/a2oberon/files/) which originally I had created and provided quite some time ago on SourceForge. Sorrily I encountered problems in creating the ISO images, which I was unable to resolve, so there are no images after Revision 6498.

2. Stuff for MacOSX (Darwin) - [UnixAos](http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/~fld/UnixAos/)

3. Extra Modules for A2 - [subversion community repository (defunc)](https://www.ocp.inf.ethz.ch/svn/ocp/trunk/) which moved [inside the new repository](https://gitlab.inf.ethz.ch/felixf/oberon/-/tree/main/ocp?ref_type=heads)

More information about A2 OS can be found in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A2_(operating_system)), the [Oberon Wikibook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Oberon), in the [A2 user guide](https://gitlab.inf.ethz.ch/felixf/oberon/-/blob/main/ocp/Documentation/A2Documentation.pdf), which is slightly outdated and was originally created by André Fischer (afaik).
